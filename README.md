# the Temple of Edfu

This repository holds a public copy of my personal dotfiles, configuration files and other stuff that I'm usually applying when doing a fresh install.

While I use this mostly as a way to sync the configuration files among multiple computers, this repository is completely public so anyone can see how I have my stuff configured, and apply said configurations if they like how it looks.

The theme is mostly based around [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), a vim color scheme.
